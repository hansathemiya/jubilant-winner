# ⚡ Elvariente Portfolio Codebase

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio site. It’s public so you can **explore**, **learn**, and maybe even be inspired—but let’s get one thing straight:

> You’re welcome to look.  
> You’re not welcome to copy.

## 🧠 Inspiration vs. Imitation

Feel free to study the structure, animations, or creative flow. But **do not reuse, republish, or repackage** any part of this codebase as your own. That includes:

- HTML/CSS/JS structure
- Custom animations and transitions
- Visual storytelling elements
- Any original assets or branding

## 🚫 No Pull Requests, No Forks

This repo is not open for contributions, forks, or collaboration requests. It’s a showcase—not a sandbox.

## ⚖️ Licensing & Protection

This project is protected under a custom license. Unauthorized use, redistribution, or duplication may result in takedowns or legal action.

> TL;DR: **Respect the work. Don’t clone the vibe.**

If you’re curious about how I built it or want to collaborate on something original, reach out the right way. Otherwise—well, you know the drill:  
**⚔️ F around and find out.**
